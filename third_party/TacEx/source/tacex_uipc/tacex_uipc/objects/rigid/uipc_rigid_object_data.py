    """Data container for a rigid uipc object.

    This class contains the data for a rigid object in the simulation. The data includes the state of
    the root rigid body and the state of all the bodies in the object. The data is stored in the simulation
    world frame unless otherwise specified.

    For a rigid body, there are two frames of reference that are used:

    - Actor frame: The frame of reference of the rigid body prim. This typically corresponds to the Xform prim
      with the rigid body schema.
    - Center of mass frame: The frame of reference of the center of mass of the rigid body.

    Depending on the settings of the simulation, the actor frame and the center of mass frame may be the same.
    This needs to be taken into account when interpreting the data.

    The data is lazily updated, meaning that the data is only updated when it is accessed. This is useful
    when the data is expensive to compute or retrieve. The data is updated when the timestamp of the buffer
    is older than the current simulation timestamp. The timestamp is updated whenever the data is updated.
